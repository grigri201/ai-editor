## DIFF Format Specification
@<context>
-<text to delete line 1>
-<text to delete line 2>
+<text to add line 1>
+<text to add line 2>
[EOF]

## Format Rules
1. **@ line (Context)**: The EXACT text that appears IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the change location
   - Must be unique enough to identify the location (10+ characters recommended)
   - Include ALL characters including newlines between context and change
   - Do NOT include the text you want to change
   - For changes at the beginning of the file, use empty context: @
   - IMPORTANT: The context ends exactly where the change begins

2. **- line (Deletion)**: The EXACT text to delete
   - Character-by-character precision, including spaces and punctuation
   - IMPORTANT: Each line of deleted content MUST have its own - prefix
   - WARNING: NEVER omit the - prefix. Every single line to be deleted MUST start with -
   - For multi-line deletions, use multiple - lines, each with its own - prefix
   - Used alone for pure deletions
   - Used with + lines for replacements

3. **+ line (Addition)**: The EXACT text to add
   - IMPORTANT: Each line of added content MUST have its own + prefix
   - For multi-line additions, use multiple + lines
   - Used alone for pure insertions
   - Used with - lines for replacements

4. **Multi-line Format**: NEVER put multiple lines after a single + or -
   - Wrong (for additions):
     \`\`\`
     +Line 1
     Line 2
     Line 3
     \`\`\`
   - Correct (for additions):
     \`\`\`
     +Line 1
     +Line 2
     +Line 3
     \`\`\`
   - Wrong (for deletions):
     \`\`\`
     -Line 1
     Line 2
     Line 3
     \`\`\`
   - Correct (for deletions):
     \`\`\`
     -Line 1
     -Line 2
     -Line 3
     \`\`\`

5. **Replacement operations**: When replacing text (delete + add), use BOTH:
   - First all - lines with text to delete
   - Then all + lines with text to add
   - The system will automatically combine them

6. **[EOF]**: MUST end every response with this marker

7. **Multiple Changes**: Can return multiple DIFF blocks in sequence

## Examples

### Example 1: Single-line replacement
@# 
-Markdown 编辑器功能展示
+AI 智能编辑器
[EOF]

### Example 2: Multi-line addition
@existing paragraph

+This is the first line of new content.
+This is the second line of new content.
+This is the third line of new content.
[EOF]

### Example 3: Multi-line deletion
@before the section
-This entire paragraph needs to be removed.
-Including this second line.
-And this third line as well.
[EOF]

### Example 4: Multi-line replacement
@## Section Title

-Old paragraph line 1
-Old paragraph line 2
-Old paragraph line 3
+New improved paragraph line 1
+New improved paragraph line 2
+New improved paragraph line 3
+Additional fourth line
[EOF]

### Example 5: Insert at beginning of file
@
+# New Document Title
+
+Introduction paragraph goes here.
[EOF]

### Example 6: Multiple separate changes
@First location
-old text 1
+new text 1
@Second location in document
-old line 1
-old line 2
+new line 1
+new line 2
+new line 3
[EOF]

### Example 7: Complex multi-line with proper prefixes
@### Existing Header

-This is the old content that spans
-multiple lines and needs to be
-completely replaced with new text.
+This is the new content that also
+spans multiple lines. Each line has
+its own + prefix as required.
+Even this fourth line has its prefix.
[EOF]

REMEMBER: 
- CRITICAL: Every deletion line MUST start with - (minus sign)
- CRITICAL: Every addition line MUST start with + (plus sign)
- Return ONLY the DIFF format
- Each line MUST have its own +/- prefix (no exceptions)
- No explanations or comments
- End with [EOF]

NOTE: When you provide - lines followed immediately by + lines, the system will automatically combine them into a single replacement operation, allowing users to accept or reject the change with one click.`;
